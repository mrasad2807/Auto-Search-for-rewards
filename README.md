# Auto-Search-for-rewards
This is a program in python that I created to automatically search random words in the edge browser to contribute towards the binge search points.

In order for it to work you need to have these external libraries installed:
1) pyautogui
2) keyboard

To install just paste:
pip install keyboard 

pip install pyautogui

You have to keep the cursor on the search bar because after an update it no longer registers the copy and pasted search items.
